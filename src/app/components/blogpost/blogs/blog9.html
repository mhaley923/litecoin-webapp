<br>
<b>What is Litecoin</b>
<br><br>

<p>Litecoin is a virtual peer-to-peer currency that is decentralized like many other cryptocurrencies. Some see Litecoin, or LTC on coin exchanges, as the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold”.  Litecoin value reached an all time high over $360 in December 2017, as the cryptocurrency market capitalization peaked as well.  Out of the thousands of legitimate cryptocurrencies on the market, Litecoin is generally regarded as a top 5 coin – in terms of market cap as well as popularity.  Compared to Bitcoin, it’s predecessor, Litecoin is much quicker to transfer, and has a cheaper cost per unit. One can imagine how the faster transfer speed makes it more suitable for consumer transactions, such as buying groceries with a crypto-backed credit card. </p>

<b>How to Buy Litecoin</b>
<br><br>
<p>The most common method investors use to initially purchase Litecoin is through crypto currency exchanges that support the coin. Popular cryptocurrency exchanges that currently allow users to buy/sell Litecoin include Coinbase, Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinmama. To name a few- differences across these platforms include coin selection (however, all four exchanges support Litecoin), options for storing cryptocurrency, a small price fluctuation, security measures/reputation, and fees. Different types of investors may choose different exchanges for one or more of these reasons. When deciding which exchange to use – verify the exchange supports customers in your country as well as the coin you are trying to purchase. Research the security history of the exchange, for example – how many times have they been hacked and how recently. Bitfinex, as an example, has been hacked multiple times and notably in August 2016 when over 120,000 BTC (almost $500 million in total value) was stolen by a group who was able to exploit the multisig wallet architecture.  Additionally, ensure you have the means to store your cryptocurrency in a digital or physical wallet once you have made the purchase. Some exchanges, such as Coinbase, allows users to store their cryptocurrency right on their platform. On the other hand, Coinmama does not allow users to store their crypto. Instead, they must provide the digital address of a separate wallet which Coinmama will send the purchase amount to.</p>

<b>How to Value Litecoin</b>
<br><br>
<p>Cryptocurrency is unlike normal, everyday fiat currency and thus investors must learn to value it differently. Investors should understand that the value of a fiat currency stems from the fact that it is backed by a central government. This government has declared its currency to have a certain value and backs it with its actions such as printing money, regulating the economy, etc. Cryptocurrencies like Litecoin are not backed by a central authority and thus do not get the same level of assurance. This leaves more room for speculation to cause, at times, dramatic price fluctuations. Traditional fiat markets like the stock market and forex market have been around for hundreds of years, giving them plenty of time to saturate and reach a relatively stable state. The cryptocurrency market, on the other hand, has existed for less than a decade. Although it has grown rapidly to a market cap of  over $100 billion world wide, it is still a pebble compared to something like the forex market, which is sitting at $5 trillion in market cap. </p>
<p>The novelty and narrowness of the crypto market makes it much more vulnerable to speculation as well as market manipulation, causing volatility. It is important to realize the risk posed by large players like exchanges and banks – who have the ability to cause dramatic market shifts. The media also plays a role in price determination. Significant positive or negative stories and developments surrounding a coin can quickly alter its price. In the long run, a coin’s fundamental technology and utility will be a major determining factor in its price movement as well.  As the years pass, there will be winners and losers in the crypto space. Governments and central authorities will impose regulations. Certain coins may or may not be adopted. A coin’s underlying technology may or may not have a real world application or solve real world problems. The summation of these factors will eventually determine a coin’s place in the market. </p>

<b>How to Store Litecoin</b>
<br><br>
<p>If you cannot store your Litecoin on an exchange or prefer the security and privacy of storing it in an independent wallet, you will need to decide which wallet  is right for you. Cryptocurrency wallets can be ‘hot’ or ‘cold’. A hot wallet is connected to the internet, whereas a cold wallet is not. There are desktop wallets, hardware wallets, web wallets, and mobile wallets. Below is an example and brief description of each type of wallet.</p>

<br>
<b>Desktop Wallet -  Exodus.io - Linux, Windows, Apple</b>
<br><br>
<p>A desktop wallet lives on your personal laptop or PC and can connect to the internet or be used offline without internet access. The internet connectivity makes the software desktop wallet inherently more risky then a hardware wallet. Many prefer this type of wallet because of the ease of use and larger screen compared to the mobile wallet. The Exodus Desktop Wallet is one of the most popular choices in this category. Users have raved about the beautiful product design as well as the extremely helpful support team. The wallet features three features – Wallet, Portfolio, and Exchange to aid you in wall investment activities.  Exodus does not charge additional fees (not including network transaction fees) for sending or receiving coins. </p>

<br>
<b>Hardware Wallet – Ledger Nano S</b>
<br><br>
<p>Some believe the most sophisticated way to store your coins are through a separate storage device that connectes to your computer through USB (or other chord) and holds your cryptocurrency offline, away from the computer. The Ledger Nano S is a hardware wallet supporting storage of the word’s top cryptocurrencies. In 2016, Ledger released the Ledger Nano S – a robust, secure hardware solution for storing cryptocurrency such as Litecoin offline. The Nano S has a built in LED screen and is more affordable than other wallets in its class, such as Trezor. When you order the device for $59.99, you will receive the Ledger Nano S device, a USB Cable, Lanyard, keychain, and key ring. You will be able to create your “seed” phrase for recovering your account if you get locked out. Ledger is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.</p>

<br>
<b>Web Wallet – Coinbase (also a popular exchange)</b>
<br><br>
<p>Web based wallets can be very convenient for the average investor, especially someone who is new to the market and is using an exchange like Coinbase that provides users with a free wallet. The tradeoff to consider is the security risk. It is inherently more risky to trust a corporation like Coinbase to store your cryptocurrency and manage your wallet. For investors primarily looking for an easy-to-use, beginner friendly wallet – the Coinbase Web Wallet would be a good fit. The Coinbase Wallet features two factor authentication, increasing its security rating, and is backed by a reputable cryptocurrency exchange. After entering basic information and a 12-word security phrase to sign up for an account – users can add their phone number – which will enable 2FA in the form of text messages to verify user login attempts. Many users enjoy having their cryptocurrency wallet and exchange together in one easy-to-use application. </p>

<br>
<b>Mobile Wallet -  Jaxx (iOS and Google Play)</b>
<br><br>
<p>In lieu of a desktop wallet, some may choose to move to the mobile wallet as so much of our digital activity is already moving to the mobile platform. The Jaxx wallet is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet available for both iPhone and Android owners. The wallet was designed to be simplistic and easy-to-use, and employs many strong security practices. Jaxx stores user’s private keys on the actual device, making it nearly impossible for an outside hacker to penetrate and control funds. User interface and usability are considers the wallets strong suits – making it straight-forward for a novice investor to download the app, create an account, and get started immediately. The one negative some have reported is the app being buggy and slow at times.</p>

<br>
<b>How to Buy Litecoin with Credit Card Or Paypal</b>
<br><br>
<p>It is slightly more difficult to use a credit card or PayPal to fund your Litecoin purchase, but it is still possible. Coinbase will allow you to use your credit card to purchase up to $500 worth of Litecoin, and once you provide more personal details and verify your identity, this limit may increase. The trading platforms Indacoin and Bitpanda  will also accept credit card payment if you are a Visa or Mastercard customer. </p>
<p>There is no direct method of purchasing Litecoin with PayPal. The round-a-bout way is purchasing Bitcoin through the Virtual World of Exchange (VirWox), transferring the Bitcoin to an exchange such as Bittrex, Poliex, etc. and exchanging the Bitcoin for Litecoin. Unfortunately, this method will incur more transaction fees than usual because of the numerous steps involved.</p>
