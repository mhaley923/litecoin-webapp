<b>Overview of Cryptocurrency Mining</b>
<br><br>

<p>Cryptocurrency exists because of the blockchain  - a decentralized ledger of all transactions ever made for a specified coin. These transactions are stored and maintained across many computers, linked together through a peer-to-peer transactional network. This means Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and every other cryptocurrency have their own dedicated blockchains. Every time a transaction is made on the blockchain, a cryptocurrency “miner” is responsible for verifying the transaction to ensure it is authentic. The verification process consists of using specialized computer hardware with plenty of processing power to run complicated algorithms repeatedly – until the transaction has been verified. Miners use hardware resources, competing with one another to solve complex mathematical equations. The first miner to solve the equation through their computer’s resources is given a designated amount of the currency they are mining for, as a reward. At this point the original transaction is verified and the miner is required to post the result of the transaction to the ledger. Some miners use their own resources to solve these cryptographic equations, others rent the resources of others through online services. </p>
<p>The next step in the mining evolution was mining pools – where miners assembled a group of GPUs controlled by a central CPU and enabled even faster mining times while using a considerably higher amount of electricity at the same time. Companies started jumping to supply mining equipment and Butterfly Labs released the ASIC miners SC Mini Rig – the most powerful mining hardware available in 2012 (100x faster than some GPUs). This type of super-fast mining technology is still used to day. Cloud mining has also risen to fashion – where prospective miners can essentially rent out computing power/electricity from anywhere in the world through the internet without setting up heavy-duty hardware in their home. Users just need to purchase a mining plan and sit back while they collect a percentage of the profit.</p>

<b>History of Cryptocurrency Mining</b>
<br><br>

<p>The difficulty of cryptocurrency mining has risen over time, and the rewards continuously shrink as each day passes. Cryptocurrency mining has existed as long as Bitcoin itself, which was founded in January 2009. In the early days an i7 Intel processor, which can be found on your average, everyday computer, could mine approximately 50 BTC per day. Although that is over $200,000/day in 2019 dollars, at the time it may have not even covered the electricity bill for that amount of processing. Miner’s eventually realized high-end GPUs (graphical processing units), which are found in embedded systems and game consoles, could mine at a much faster rate. GPUs were mainly used for accelerated image processing and could run 250 times faster than a regular CPU such as the i7 Intel processor. </p>

<b>What does the miner get in return? Motivations</b>
<br><br>

<p> The motivation for the majority of cryptocurrency miners is simple – make as much profit as possible from their investment in local computing power or on a cloud mining platform. How do miners make a profit? They earn more in cryptocurrency than spent in equipment, pool/platform fees, and electricity consumed while running said equipment. The more a miner spends in mining equipment (mining Rigs, ASICs, GPUs, etc.) the longer it will take to break even on their investment. The higher the cost of electricity (kwh) in their area, the less profit they will receive. </p>
<p> Often times, profit will be determined when the initial investment is made and the cryptocurrency they are mining for is determined. Many individual miners purchase an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) for their crypto mining, it is basically the gold standard of mining equipment in 2019. There are a few important factors to look for when purchasing your ASIC miner that will have a huge impact on your profit potential. First, look at the hash rate. Every ASIC miner has a hash rate, which is essentially how fast it can mine for the currency at hand. A good hashrate for Bitcoin miners would be up around 20 TH/s (Terahashes per second), whereas a good rate for Litecoin would be north of 500 MH/s (Megahashes per second). “Hashes per second” references how fast the computer can run the algorithm required to verify transactions of that currency and receive the block reward. Second, look at the power consumption. This will be a number like 800 W, which is referring to the amount of power the machine pulls from the wall of your house. The lower the power consumption, the higher your profit will be. Lastly, look at the price of the ASIC compared to how much profit you anticipate to make (There are many free mining profitability tools). If the miner costs $1000 and the expected ROI is $100/month, keep in mind it will take 10 months to break even. </p>

<b>Why Mine Litecoin?</b>
<br><br>

<p>The profitability of mining a given currency is based on the “difficulty” of that coin as well as the “block reward” and the current value. The difficult is a seemingly arbitrary number that naturally indicates how hard it is to reap the reward from mining. The block reward is the number of coins you will receive when you verify a block of transactions. At the time I am writing this, the Bitcoin block reward is 12.5 BTC and the Litecoin block reward is 25 LTC, however one BTC is worth nearly 10x one LTC in USD. As time increases, and more of a coin has been mined, the difficulty to mine the coin increases and the block reward decreases. Some believe that the reward for mining prominent coins like Bitcoin has become too low and are turning to other altcoins for higher profit potential. A major advantage Litecoin has over Bitcoin is the transaction time – 2.5 minutes – which is 4x faster than it’s big brother Bitcoin. Some have speculated that Litecoin will be more easily applied to consumer transactions for this reason. The 2.5 minute transaction time is the same as Litecoin’s 2.5 minute block generation time (still 4x faster than Bitcoin). Since miners only earn currency when a block is generated, Litecoin miners have more opportunity to successfully generate a block and get the block reward. Bitcoin is a more mature, popular cryptocurrency and is therefore farther in it’s development cycle. This indicates that the mining market is more saturated given there are far fewer coins left to mine. Bitcoin’s max supply is 21 million coins, whereas Litecoin’s lifetime maximum is 84 million coins.</p>

<b>How to Mine Litecoin?</b>
<br><br>

<p>When getting into Litecoin, it is important to note that Litecoin uses a different proof-of-work algorithm than Bitcoin. This is the algorithm or computer program that the mining hardware runs in attempt to generate blocks. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm whereas Litecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm. A main difference is that SHA-256 favors computers with high CPU speed/processing power, meaning it is compute-intensive. The Scrypt algorithm is designed to be memory-intensive and favors computers with plenty of RAM (random access memory). As a Litecoin miner, you will be far better served purchasing hardware (most likely an ASIC miner) that is designed specifically to run the Srypt algorithm. An additional benefit of choosing a Scrypt ASIC Miner is the ability to mine other cryptocurrencies that employ the Scrypt algorithm for proof-of-work, such as Dogecoin! There are less hardware options for the Scrypt algorithm. With that said, the Antminer L3++ is considered the gold standard in the Scrypt ASIC market. Depending on the model, this ASIC will run at around 500 MH/s and pull about 800 W in power. This hash rate may seem inferior to the majority of Bitcoin ASICs on the market – but that is not the point of Srypt mining. Employing greater processing power does not always translate to superior results while mining Litecoin. Wondering how much money can the Antminer L3++ make you? Well, as always, the profit potential will depend on the current market situation. It is worth noting that these machines have earned individuals hundreds in weekly mining profit during bull markets, but also broke even or had negative time periods during bear markets.</p>

<b>Solo Mining or Pool Mining?</b>
<br><br>

<p>A mining pool is a group of miners combining their hardware resources and agreeing to share their mining profits amongst other miners in the pool. The advantage of this is a higher probability of generating blocks and receiving some sort of profit on a regular basis. This probability increases with more miners working together in a pool. The downside is splitting the profit of block generation amongst a community of people. An individual miner gets to keep all the profit from block generation, however they less likely to generate blocks and receive profit on a regular basis. A mining pool may be a good option for beginners looking for experience in the cryptocurrency mining space. </p>
<p>There are a couple different approaches in mining pools. One approach is a proportional distribution. This means whenever a block is generated and profit is received, the earnings are split amongst every miner. Another approach is the pay-per-share system. In this system, participants are paid based on the statistically expected earnings of the pool. This means a probability is calculated based on the group metrics, and the payment plan is determined before any profit has been made. The group could make more or less profit than expected, but the pay-out to miners will not change. This gives miners a steady stream of income and peace of mind. Litecoinpool.org is one of the longest-standing pool mining platforms. It features eight servers all over the world and uses the pay-per-share systems. Another popular mining pool is ProHashing, one of the world’s most popular Litecoin mining pools. This platform also gives you the ability to mine SHA-226, Equihash, and x11 algorithm coins.</p>
